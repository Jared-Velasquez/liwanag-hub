# liwanag-hub
Central reference point for Liwanag, a Tagalog language-learning app.

This repository acts as an entry point into Liwanag. Here, you will find links to individual services, high-level descriptions, and (over time) architecture diagrams.

## Current Public Repositories:
- [**Gamification Service (Java Spring)**](https://github.com/Jared-Velasquez/liwanag-gamification-service)
  Handles XP, levels, streaks, achievements, and leaderboards to keep learners motivated.
  
- [**Practice Service (Java Spring)**](https://github.com/Jared-Velasquez/liwanag-practice-service)
  Serves practice questions, evaluates answers, and integrates with content services to facilitate the learners' progress.

- [**Progress Service (Java Spring)**](https://github.com/Jared-Velasquez/liwanag-progress-service)
  Tracks user progress on Liwanag units, episodes, and activities.
  
- [**Canonical Content**](https://github.com/Jared-Velasquez/liwanag-canonical-content)
  Stores and manages the static Liwanag learning content, acting as the authoritative source of questions, activities, episodes, and units.

## Roadmap

Liwanag is still in active development. As the system grows, this hub will evolve to include:
- **Links to additional microservices** (e.g. question generation, notifications).
- **Architecture Diagrams** to visualize interactions between services.
- **Development Guides** to explain design decisions and document best practices across the project.
